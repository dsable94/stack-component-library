## Legacy components

If the component you are looking for is not available in Stack UI Kit, you are entitled to use Legacy component under specific circumstance. Once we have created, we will ask you to replace it moving forward.

If your application is currently using Material UI components, we recommend you follows the instructions below:

- Recommend to remove `@material-ui/core`, `@material-ui/styles`, `@material-ui/icons` in package.json
- Update all Material UI components reference with a prefix “Legacy” and import from “@dentsu/components”.

Eg. Instead of `import { Button } from ‘@material-ui/core’`, it should be `import { LegacyButton } from ‘@dentsu/components’`
