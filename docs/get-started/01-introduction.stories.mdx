# Stack UI Kit

> **Component Library** from Stack UI Design System, by Successive Software.

**At Stack UI, we want to create a cohesive experience for our users. This system will enable teams to be more efficient, have a shared language across the company, and focus deeper on solving user problems.**

This is a constantly evolving project that seeks to improve composability and usability of Stack UI's product user interface.

Components are one of the key building blocks of the design system. Each component has been designed and coded to solve a specific UI problem, such as presenting a list of options, enabling submission of a form, providing feedback to the user, and so on. All of the components have been designed to work harmoniously together, as parts of a greater whole.


## Foundations

These are the principles that the design system is built on. Modifications to these principles affect the component's behavior. These include foundational elements such as colors, grid, and typography.

## Components

This section contains the common components that are essential to build interfaces. Each component defines its rules and behaviors. Each component's look and feel is based on the combination of the foundations mentioned above. Therefore, changes to the foundation principles propagate to the entire system.

<!-- ## Screens

Screens offer prebuilt solutions to tackle repetitive interface challenges. They speed up the design process, as they only require minor modifications to fit your use case and display your content.

## Add-ons

These components are for the needs of specific products or applications. They are built using Stack UI Design System's foundations and components. They belong to the product or application that created them, rather than the design system itself. Therefore, they are not supported in Stack UI Kit and shouldn't be support in any base implementation. -->
