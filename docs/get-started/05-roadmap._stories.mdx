## Improving accessibility documentation

To help people that design and develop with Dentsu Kit, we're working on adding improved documentation around building accessible features with the system. Style guide documentation will clarify which accessibility supports are built into components, how components are expected to work for people using assistive technologies, and what might additionally need to be considered or implemented based on how components are being used.
