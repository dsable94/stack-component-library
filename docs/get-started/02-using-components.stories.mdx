# Using components

Here are some basic instructions to help you get started:

## React components (recommended)

### Install

```bash
# Using npm
$ npm install git+https://bitbucket.org/successivesoftware/stack-component-library.git

# Using Yarn
$ yarn add git+https://bitbucket.org/successivesoftware/stack-component-library.git
```

### Import Stack UI Kit styles (included fonts)

We suggest add the style file into your own project at the root level.

```js
@import '@stack-ui/components/styles.css';
```

### JavaScript environment requirements

React 16 depends on the collection types `Map` and `Set`. If you support older browsers and devices which may not yet provide these natively (e.g. IE < 11) or which have non-compliant implementations (e.g. IE 11), consider including a global polyfill in your bundled application, such as `core-js`.

A polyfilled environment for React 16 using core-js to support older browsers might look like:

```js
import "core-js/stable";
import "regenerator-runtime/runtime";

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

React also depends on requestAnimationFrame (even in test environments). You can use the `raf` package to shim requestAnimationFrame:

```jsx
import 'raf/polyfill';
```

## Component methodology

We make our components flexible enough to meet diverse needs. Our components are set up to be restructured based on the information passed in. No matter what type of experience you’re creating, you can use components as the building blocks of your product or feature.

Each of our components has a well-documented public interface (API) with guidelines and well-defined conventions. This way, developers don’t need to worry about the underlying implementation. Instead, they can focus on creating great merchant experiences.

We ensure that our components are made for everyone. They meet accessibility standards and are responsive to any screen or device. We also put a lot of effort into optimizing the performance of the components, so everyone can build inclusive experiences that work.
